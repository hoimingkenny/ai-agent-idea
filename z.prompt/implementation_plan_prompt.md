 Role: Act as a Senior Software Architect and Lead Developer.

Goal: Transform the following project description into a comprehensive, actionable Technical Implementation Plan in Markdown. 

Input Project Description:



Requirements for the Plan:

1. Project Summary : Briefly summarize the project's goal and core value proposition.
2. Technical Architecture & Stack :
   - Stack Selection : Recommend a specific, modern technology stack (Language, Frameworks, Database, Tools). Explain why each tool was chosen (e.g., "LangGraph for cyclic state management," "Docker for isolation").
   - Architecture Diagram : Provide a Mermaid.js chart (flowchart, state machine, or sequence diagram) visualizing the system's core logic.
   - Data Schemas : Define key data structures (e.g., State objects, Database models, API schemas) with type hints.
   - Architecture Mapping : Explicitly map the project's "Key Architectural Decisions" (from the input) to the specific phases of your plan.
3. Detailed Implementation Plan :
   - Break development into 3-4 Phases (e.g., Foundation, Core Logic, Advanced Features, Polish).
   - For each phase, provide:
     - Goal : What is being achieved?
     - File Structure : Expected directory layout (e.g., src/agent/graph.py ).
     - Key Tasks : Concrete steps, including specific function signatures or class names to implement.
4. Development Priorities : A prioritized list of tasks (P0: Critical, P1: Important, P2: Nice-to-have).
Tone : Professional, technical, and biased towards action. Focus on how to build it, not just what it is.
