**Role:** Act as a Senior Technical Recruiter and Engineering Manager at a top-tier tech company (FAANG/MAANG level).

**Context:** I have built a technical project and I need to translate the technical details into a compelling narrative for my CV, portfolio, and interview talking points.

**Input:** Below is the technical implementation plan / architecture of my project:
Read the implementation_plan.md file.

**Task:** Please generate a "Learning Outcomes & Portfolio Guide" markdown document with the following 4 sections:

1.  **Project Challenges:**
    *   Identify 3-4 distinct technical or architectural hurdles inherent in this specific stack/domain (e.g., "managing memory pressure on mobile," "handling distributed state," "optimizing inference latency").
    *   Don't just list features; explain *why* they were hard to build.

2.  **The "Why" (Problem Solved):**
    *   Explain the value proposition in business or user terms.
    *   Why does this project matter? (e.g., "Eliminates cloud costs," "Ensures privacy," "Works in low-connectivity environments").

3.  **CV/Resume Summary:**
    *   Write a concise, punchy 3-4 sentence paragraph suitable for the "Projects" section of a resume.
    *   **Requirements:** Use strong action verbs (Engineered, Architected, Optimized). Mention the specific tech stack. Highlight a specific metric or optimization if possible (e.g., "Reduced latency by...").

4.  **Key Learning Outcomes (Star Method Prep):**
    *   List 3 key skills or competencies demonstrated by this project.
    *   For each, provide a brief bullet point on *how* I demonstrated it. This will help me answer "What did you learn?" in interviews.

**Tone:** Professional, confident, and technically precise. Focus on engineering trade-offs and architectural decisions.
